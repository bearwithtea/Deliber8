# Swiftlet
#### A Quizlet clone built entirely with Swift and accessible through the CLI
### Why
One of my favorite studying tools is Quizlet. It is one of the few applications that I find the premium version worth paying for. However, it can be slow and quite bloated since it is limited by being a web app. and wrapped in a (very pretty) UI.

Since I have used Quizlet for quite a while, I understand what makes it so powerful. It isn't the AI features or the extra study modes; it's the ability to create and review flashcards really quickly.

I wanted to recreated this within the command line making it even faster and easier.
